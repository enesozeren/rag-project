# Step 3: Run the Docker container.
# -v "$(pwd)":/submission mounts the current directory ($(pwd) outputs the current directory path)
# to /submission inside the container. This way, the container can access the contents
# of the current directory as if they were located at /submission inside the container.
# 'python /submission/local_evaluation.py' is the command executed inside the container.
# the -w sets the workind directory to /submission.
# It then local_evaluation.py using software runtime set up in the Dockerfile.

    $IMAGE_NAME python local_evaluation.py

# Note: We assume you have nvidia-container-toolkit installed and configured 
# to use the --gpus all flag. If you are not using GPUs, you can remove this flag.


# Note 1: Please refer to the Dockerfile to understand how the software runtime is set up.
# The Dockerfile should include all necessary commands to install Python, the necessary
# dependencies, and any other software required to run local_evaluation.py.

# Note 2: Note the .dockerignore file in the root of this directory.
# In the .dockerignore file, specify any files or directories that should not be included
# in the Docker context. This typically includes large files, models, or datasets that
# are not necessary for building the Docker image. Excluding these can significantly
# speed up the build process by reducing the size of the build context sent to the Docker daemon.

# Ensure your Dockerfile and .dockerignore are properly set up before running this script.

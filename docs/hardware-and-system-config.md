## Hardware and System Configuration
We apply a limit on the hardware available to each participant to run their solutions.

- All solutions will be run on [AWS g4dn.12xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/) instances equipped with [NVIDIA T4 GPUs](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/). 
- The hardware available is: 
    - `4` x [NVIDIA T4 GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/s). 
    - `40` x vCPU (`20` physical CPU cores)
    - `180GB` RAM

**Note**: When running in `gpu:false` mode, you will have access to `4` x vCPUs (`2` physical cores) and `8GB` RAM. 

Please note that NVIDIA T4 uses a somewhat outdated architecture and is thus not compatible with certain acceleration toolkits (e.g. Flash Attention), so please be careful about compatibility.

Besides, the following restrictions will also be imposed: 

- Network connection will be disabled.
- Each submission will be assigned a certain amount of time to run. Submissions that exceed the time limits will be killed and will not be evaluated. The tentative time limit is set as follows **[TO BE ADDED AND TESTED WITH AICROWD SUBMISSION SYSTEM]**. 

- Each team will be able to make up to **1 submission per day**, with a maximum of **[TO BE ADDED AND TESTED WITH AICROWD SUBMISSION SYSTEM]**. 

Based on the hardware and system configuration, we recommend participants to begin with 7B and 13B models. According to our experiments, models like Llama-2 13B can perform inference smoothly on 4 NVIDIA T4 GPUs, while 13B models will result in OOM.

            List[str]: A list of plain text responses for each query in the batch. Each response is limited to 75 tokens.
            If the generated response exceeds 75 tokens, it will be truncated to fit within this limit.

        Notes:
        - If the correct answer is uncertain, it's preferable to respond with "I don't know" to avoid
          the penalty for hallucination.
        - Response Time: Ensure that your model processes and responds to each query within 30 seconds.
          Failing to adhere to this time constraint **will** result in a timeout during evaluation.
